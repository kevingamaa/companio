## SETUP

In your project folder run the command `npm i`

## Overview

Every night we receive list of players with their: name, team, status, and points for the day.  
We need a function that aggregates points by team, and sorts teams in descending order by total points.  
Only active players should be considered for team points calculation.

## TESTING && RUNNING

Currently the only way to test and run the code is by Jest tests. With that in mind after the setup
you can just run this command `npm run test`
